      <description>As a Java developer, I &amp;lsquo;ve always had argument with my colleagues to use Scala instead Java. They complained that Scala is a complex language and Java is a more readable and simple one so I never had the opportunity to use Scala well. Fortunately, recently I &amp;lsquo;ve just joined to the startup company called snapptrip.com, and we use Scala for all the backend services. A few days ago, I was working on a peace of code in Scala to register a new user into the database.</description>
