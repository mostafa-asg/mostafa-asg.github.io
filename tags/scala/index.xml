This time I searched in functional programming category and crosswords-101 caught my eye and I decided to solve it in Scala in a very clean and understandable way and not in a contest style way of programming!
This article is going to reveal how I solved this puzzle.</description>

      <description>As a Java developer, I &amp;rsquo;ve always had argument with my colleagues to use Scala instead Java. They complained that Scala is a complex language and Java is a more readable and simple one so I never had the opportunity to use Scala well. Fortunately, recently I &amp;rsquo;ve just joined to the startup company called snapptrip.com, and we use Scala for all the backend services. A few days ago, I was working on a peace of code in Scala to register a new user into the database.</description>

      <description>Definition of DSL A DSL is a computer language, specialized for a specific domain. A DSL is essentially the opposite of a general programming languages(GPL), I mean every language that can be used to develop something. For example, Java, C#, and Scala are all GPL languages. With a DSL, we want only to solve a specific domain problem, so we design the language specifically for the domain. A DSL canâ€™t be used outside of the domain, because it is not designed for flexibility.</description>
