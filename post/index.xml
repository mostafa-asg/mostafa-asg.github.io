      <description>Introduction Whenever a developer or system admin faces an issue with the system, the first instinct is to look at the logs. For a long time, we have relied on basic tools like grep, awk, or perl to perform log analysis. However, with changing times and cloud-scale applications, the earlier techniques no longer suffice. Imagine a system with tens, hundreds, or thousands of hosts. There are multiple instances of different applications running on all these hosts.</description>

      <description>Introduction Understanding the performance of mission critical API is crucial. Before you deploy your API, probably you want to know, how your API behaves under heavy loads. Most API nowadays are HTTP-based, and that&amp;rsquo;s why there are numerous HTTP load testing tools available. Here is just a few:

      <guid>https://mostafa-asg.github.io/post/reactive-systems-vs-reactive-programming/</guid>
      <description>This is the digest of Reactive Programming versus Reactive Systems by Jonas Bonér and Viktor Klang. This is for anyone who does not have enough time to study the original white paper. It is the shortest version without sacrificing important stuff.
Reactive - A Set Of Design Principles  “Reactive” is a set of design principles for creating cohesive systems. In a Reactive System, it’s the interaction between the individual parts that makes all the difference, which is the ability to operate individually yet act in concert to achieve their intended result.</description>

      <description>In this post, I &amp;rsquo;m going to introduce you some useful aspects of Cats library, mostly code snippets and I &amp;rsquo;m not going to delve into any theory or mathematics. Hopefully you will use them in your daily codes, resulting in much more simpler and readable code.
map using Functor You are already familiar with the prominent map method in Scala. Informally, a functor is any context with a map method.</description>

      <description>As a software engineer, I always enjoy solving problems and that&amp;rsquo;s why I sometimes go to the coding challenge websites like hackerrank and pick one problem to solve. This time I searched in functional programming category and crosswords-101 caught my eye and I decided to solve it in Scala in a very clean and understandable way and not in a contest style way of programming!
This article is going to reveal how I solved this puzzle.</description>

      <description>As a Java developer, I &amp;rsquo;ve always had argument with my colleagues to use Scala instead Java. They complained that Scala is a complex language and Java is a more readable and simple one so I never had the opportunity to use Scala well. Fortunately, recently I &amp;rsquo;ve just joined to the startup company called snapptrip.com, and we use Scala for all the backend services. A few days ago, I was working on a peace of code in Scala to register a new user into the database.</description>

      <guid>https://mostafa-asg.github.io/post/writing-internal-dsl-in-scala/</guid>
      <description>Definition of DSL A DSL is a computer language, specialized for a specific domain. A DSL is essentially the opposite of a general programming languages(GPL), I mean every language that can be used to develop something. For example, Java, C#, and Scala are all GPL languages. With a DSL, we want only to solve a specific domain problem, so we design the language specifically for the domain. A DSL can’t be used outside of the domain, because it is not designed for flexibility.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wanted to show your work which is running on your local machine to your colleagues or friends? If they are far away of you, how will you show them? Will you upload your source code to github to share it with your friends? But what if you don&amp;rsquo;t like to share your source code with others? Will you run it on public or private cloud or something like that?</description>

      <title>5 ways to customize Spring MVC JSON/XML output</title>
      <link>https://mostafa-asg.github.io/post/customize-json-xml-spring-mvc-output/</link>

      <guid>https://mostafa-asg.github.io/post/customize-json-xml-spring-mvc-output/</guid>
      <description>To adhere to guidelines or requirements, API designers may want to control how JSON/XML responses are formatted. Spring Web makes use of Jackson to perform JSON/XML serialization. Therefore, to customize our output format, we must configure the Jackson processor. Spring Web offers XML-based or Java-based approaches to handling configuration. In this article, we will look at the Java-based configuration.
Enable XML output First of all, if you have created your project through https://start.</description>

      <title>Function Memorization in Go</title>

      <guid>https://mostafa-asg.github.io/post/function-memorization-in-go/</guid>
      <description>Memoization is an optimization technique used to increase performance by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same input occurs again. In this post I show how function memoization can be implemented in Go, in a pure functional manner.
Based on wikipedia definition, a function may be considered a pure function if both of the following statements about the function hold:
1. The function always evaluates the same result value given the same argument value(s).</description>

      <description>Today I learned something new that I want to share with you. I knew that listening on port below 1024 requires special privilege, and to accomplish that you must be sudoers. But running applications with sudo is not a perfect way because that way the application can do almost anything to your operating system resulting unexpected results (you surely don&amp;rsquo;t want the application delete all your files by rm -rf).</description>

      <title>Enhance Hadoop MapReduce Speed for small jobs</title>
      <link>https://mostafa-asg.github.io/post/enhance-hadoop-mapreduce-speed-small-jobs/</link>

      <description>Introduction There are some circumstances when input of Hadoop&amp;rsquo;s MapReduce is relatively small. Consequently the overhead of allocating and running tasks in new containers outweighs the gain to be had in running them in parallel, compared to running them sequentially on one node. Such a job is said to be uberized, or run as an uber task.
Enable uber optimization To enable uberized job, simply set mapreduce.job.ubertask.enable to true. But that is not sufficient.</description>

      <description>Last week I decided to dirty my hands with Kafka Streams. I wanted to write simple application with Kafka Streams more interesting than World Count. I decided to write a program that calculates top 5 using Kafka Streams. Imagine you have written a game, and you want to display top 5 users. You also need that calculating and displaying top 5 to be real time. You need whenever a user has hit a record, it automatically displays user record.</description>

      <description>Perhaps the ordinary way to produce messages to the Kafka is through the standard Kafka clients. But if you want to just produce text messages to the Kafak, there are simpler ways.In this tutorial I &amp;rsquo;ll show you 3 ways of sending text messages to the Kafka.
kafka-console-producer One way is through kafka-console-producer that is bundled with Kafka distribution. For example to send a file to the Kafka, you can write:</description>

      <description>Introduction In the previous post, we &amp;rsquo;ve learned how to create a cluster of machines using Docker Swarm, and how to ask Swarm to run 2 instances of Nginx on those machines.In this post, we will learn how to run our custom applications on the cluster.
We &amp;rsquo;re going to implement two services using Go, one of them is fontend service and the other is backend service. The user can interact only with frontend service.</description>

      <description>Say Hello to Docker Swarm (part 1) In this tuturial I want to show you, how you can create cluster of machines using Docker Swarm and how to run your services on docker swarm.I assume you have basic knowledge of Docker.On part 2, we will implement our services on Golang, and will run them on docker swarm, so stay tuned.
Install Docker Machine In this tutorial I use docker-machine to simulate physical machines.</description>
